This is a standalone application which exposes rubycas-client's 
cas_proxy_callback feature.  It reads its configuration from bcsec's central
parameters file to reduce duplicate configuration.  The expected name for the
central parameters file is based on RAILS_ENV:

  RAILS_ENV   Expected filename
  =========   =================
  development /etc/nubic/bcsec-local.yml
  staging     /etc/nubic/bcsec-staging.yml
  production  /etc/nubic/bcsec-prod.yml

If these defaults don't work for you, you can set the environment variable
BCSEC_CENTRAL to the path you'd prefer to use.
